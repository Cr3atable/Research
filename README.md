# Snakeroom Alliance Research

This repository contains research for Reddit events (mainly for April Fools' Day) conducted by [the Snakeroom Alliance](https://discord.gg/CNahEjU).

## Structure

Each top-level directory represents a year in Reddit history, and all subdirectories represent events occurring that year. Event directories contain Markdown files with research and other historical information for that event.
