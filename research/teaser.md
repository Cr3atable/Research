# Teaser

On the evening of March 29, 2019, [the teaser page](https://reddit.com/sequence) <!-- needs archiving --> was opened. Alongside this discovery, [the ARG](arg.md) 

In the source of the page, several things could be found including a comment referencing sneks. <!-- insert comment -->

## Background

The background was larger than what can fit on the page. <!-- add image of bg -->

## JavaScript

Additionally, there was a minified JavaScript file <!-- add link to minified and beautified archives --> for sequence only. This file contained multiple API paths.

[File uploading APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) are required. If missing, a message is displayed. <!-- add text and image of text --> Files are uploaded <!-- which endpoints? --> and will be rejected if not of a valid type <!-- what types are valid? -->

From this source code, we can gather a few things:

* You can upload a video or GIF.
* You can have a description/title/caption that is up to 50 characters long.
* You can vote on submissions.
* You can report submissions, with the default being `One-click sequence report`. <!-- might be wrong; from memory -->
* You can crosspost submissions.
* There are scenes and sequences.
