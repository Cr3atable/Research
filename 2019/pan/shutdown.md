The shutdown of the Reddit Public Access Network occurred on Friday, August 23, 2019, five days after it began, at 8:00 PM ET. 15 seconds later, u/fuzzypercentage (an admin) posted, distinguished, and stickied [Good night RPAN!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pan/comments/cum45p/good_night_rpan/). Afterwards, users lost access to the RPAN experiment, meaning UI elements would disappear and all attempts to access [/rpan](https://www.reddit.com/rpan) would result in the text 'Not Found' appearing.
