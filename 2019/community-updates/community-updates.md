Congratulations on creating a brand new community on Reddit! Because creating your community is only the beginning, we're reaching out to share some tips that can help your community grow and succeed.

The way your community looks can have an immediate impact on visitors by helping it stand out and communicating what your subreddit is about. Because of this, we recommend that you visit your [moderation dashboard](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008425592) and update some key visual elements via your [community appearance tools.](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008722771)

Some of the most impactful elements you can easily update include:

*  [Your community's avatar](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008805651)

*  [Your community's banner image](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010112892)

*  [And your sidebar widgets](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010364372)

Taking the time to add these and [other visual and functional styling elements](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008722771) helps improve the chances of having a successful new community.

If you have any feedback about the resources in this message, please respond and let us know so that we can provide better information to new community creators in the future.

Thank you for helping to make Reddit awesome!
