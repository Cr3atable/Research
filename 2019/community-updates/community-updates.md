# Community Updates

The community updates experiment involves the admin account [u/CommunityUpdates](https://www.reddit.com/user/CommunityUpdates), which was created on <time datetime="2019-08-23T21:58:05.000Z">8/23/2019, 5:58:05 PM EST</time>. The account sends multiple private messages to creators of new subreddits. Every message has the subject `Tips for successfully growing your community`.

Each message is sent around a day after the previous. The scheduling is not precise; for example, the first message for a community came at <time datetime="2019-09-07T20:27:39.000Z">9/7/2019, 4:27:39 PM EST</time>, and the second came slightly over a day later at <time datetime="2019-09-08T20:30:15.000Z">9/8/2019, 4:30:15 PM EST</time>.

If a user creates multiple subreddits, they will recieve the series of tips multiple times in parallel.

## Structure

Each message's content is mostly the same albeit with new tips, having the following structure:

```markdown
Congratulations on creating a brand new community on Reddit! Because creating your community is only the beginning, we're reaching out to share some tips that can help your community grow and succeed.

<!-- An introduction to a part of community leadership -->

<!-- A list with 3 items relating to this part of community leadership -->

Taking the time to <!-- follow these tips --> helps improve the chances of <!-- new community success -->.

## Tips

### Community Appearance Tip

Creating a subreddit/community <!-- on new reddit? all subreddits or just some? --> causes the following private message to immediately be sent from the u/CommunityUpdates account, focusing on the appearance of the new community:

```markdown

The way your community looks can have an immediate impact on visitors by helping it stand out and communicating what your subreddit is about. Because of this, we recommend that you visit your [moderation dashboard](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008425592) and update some key visual elements via your [community appearance tools.](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008722771)

### Visitor Interactions Tip

Another tip is sent a day later with a similar structure, instead highlighting how content can be added to the community in order to allow visitors to interact with it:
